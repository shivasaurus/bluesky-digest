Mahoot is a working proof-of-concept software that implements a client-side curation protocol for the decentralized microblogging network Mastodon. It provides fine-grained control on how you consume Mastodon content. The Mahoot protocol is implemented as modifications to Pinafore, an open-source web client for Mastodon.
Normally, social media platforms have algorithms that are optimized to benefit the company that owns them â€” the more time people spend on the platform, the more money a commercial platform makes. This isn't necessarily optimal for you, as it may not be the most productive use of your time. The non-commercial Mastodon comes with no default algorithm to curate the feed, which sounds good in principle but has its own downsides. A "firehose" approach does not scale well when you start to follow lots of people (or topics). This may dissuade you from increasing your followee count thus restricting the range of opinions you are exposed to.
Mahoot takes a different approach. The goal is to limit, not maximize, your social media interaction time. The Mahoot algorithm tries to statistically optimize your social interaction within a specified limit. Of course, you can increase the limit anytime you feel like it. The open nature of the Mastodon network allows anyone to implement such an algorithm.
When you use Mahoot, you start by specifying how many posts (or "toots") you wish to view per day on the average. On some days you'll view more and on some days less, depending upon how active your followees are each day. Statistics of your feed activity computed over a period (usually 30 days) is used to enforce this "soft" limit.
A basic premise of Mahoot is that if you follow someone, you wish to see at least some of the content they post. We'd like to listen to different voices in the media, but commercial algorithms may promote a louder voice more than a softer voice. Posts by "less popular" users may never be seen even by people who follow them. This often discourages such users from posting at all.
By default, Mahoot will guarantee each of your followees a certain number of views (or impressions) per day, known as the Mahoot Number. The default Mahoot Number will be typically larger than the number of desired daily views divided by the number of followees, because not all your followees will post that frequently. Say you follow 150 people and wish to view 300 posts per day, the default Mahoot Number may be 7, rather than 2. (See the protocol description for more detail.)
Relying on natural (rather than artificial) intelligence, Mahoot allows you to easily amp up (or amp down) the Mahoot Number of any followee, to allow more or fewer views per day. You can use this feature to ensure that you always see someone's posts. You can also use it to reduce views of those who post interesting stuff, but too much of it every day. Typically, you will need to adjust the Mahoot number only for a fraction of your followees to take control of your feed. Doing that can free up view time that you can use to follow more people and explore different content.
When you amp up a followee, it will boost their own Mahoot Number, but lower the default Mahoot Number because the others will receive a somewhat smaller share of the average daily views. The amped up (or amped down) Mahoot numbers remain private and will not be seen by any of your followees. (You may choose to publicly advertise your default Mahoot number in your Mastodon bio, so that any followee can easily assess how likely you are to see their posts.)
If someone you follow generates less than their Mahoot Number of posts per day, all their posts are guaranteed to appear in your timeline. If they generate more, then Mahoot will display a random subset equalling their Mahoot Number. (There are optional/experimental features under development that will enable either you or the followee to prioritize which of their posts will be displayed.)
Mahoot will also implement a feature where you can curate some posts into digests or "editions" during specific times of the day. For example, you can configure posts from certain followees (or on certain topics) to be collected and displayed in a Morning Edition at 9AM and Evening Edition at 6PM (say). This feature is still in an early stage of development.
